You’ve come to the right place! In this article, we’ll teach you how to play and win at this popular card game.</p>
<p>First things first - what is Pontoon Casino? Pontoon Casino is a variation of the blackjack card game. It’s played with two decks of cards, and the goal is to score as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player who achieves this score wins the hand.</p>
<p>Pontoon Casino is a very strategic game, and there are several ways to win. In this guide, we’ll teach you the basics of the game, as well as some tips and tricks to help you come out on top. So let’s get started!</p>
<p>How to Play Pontoon Casino</p>
<p>The basic rules of Pontoon Casino are very simple. The game is played with two decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face down. The goal is to score as close to 21 as possible - without going over.</p>
<p>The player who achieves this score wins the hand. If both players have 21 or less, the hand is a tie (or “pontoon”). If either player goes over 21, they lose automatically.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some special rules that apply when you achieve a pontoon. We’ll cover those later in this article.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how to play each turn. On your turn, you must first choose whether to hit or stand. To hit means to take another card from the deck in an attempt to get closer to 21. To stand means that you’re happy with your current total and don’t want any more cards.</p>
<p>If you hit and go over 21, you automatically lose the hand (just like in blackjack). If you hit and end up with a total of 22 or more, this is called a bust and you automatically lose as well. However, if your total is less than 22, you may choose to take another card (hit) or stop taking cards (stand).</p>
<p>When both players have either hit or stood, the dealer will turn over their cards. The dealer must always stand on 17 or higher, and must draw another card if their total is 16 or lower (which means they could go bust). The winner of the hand is the player who has the highest total - not necessarily 21!</p>
<p>Pontoon Casino Strategy</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play basic Pontoon Casino hands, it’s time for some strategy tips! Here are a few things that will help you win more often:</p>
<p>  Use basic strategy charts . These helpful charts outline exactly what action you should take in any situation - depending on your hand total and the dealer’s upcard . They can be found online quite easily .</p>
<p>  Try not to go over 21 . This may sound like common sense , but it’s actually very easy to do in Pontoon Casino . If possible , try not to exceed a hand total of 20 .</p>
<p>  Look for opportunities to split pairs . When you’re dealt two cards of the same rank , you can choose to split them into two separate hands (this works similarly to blackjack ). If both hands end up winning , you’ll earn double the payout !</p>
<p>  Watch out for doubling down opportunities . Doubling down basically means doubling your bet , in exchange for just one more card . This can be a risky move , but it can also pay off handsomely if done correctly .</p>

Here are 10 secrets to winning at pontoon that will help you crush the competition and take home some serious cash.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep a close eye on your cards. This may seem like common sense, but many players lose sight of their cards in the heat of the moment. Make sure you track every card that’s played and remember what’s been revealed. This will give you a good idea of what sorts of hands are possible and how best to play your current hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined. It can be tempting to go all in when you have a strong hand, but it’s important to remember that pontoon is a game of patience. Sometimes it’s best to play conservatively and wait for a better opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts as a guide. Pontoon is not a completely random game and there are certain statistically sound plays you can make to improve your chances of winning. Basic strategy charts provide detailed information on which moves to make in any given situation, so be sure to use them as a reference when playing online casino caesar slots games pontoon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take advantage of bonuses and promotions. Many online casinos offer generous bonuses to players who sign up, deposit, or play certain games. Be sure to take advantage of these offers and use the extra cash to increase your chances of winning big bucks at pontoon!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice makes perfect! Like any other skill, practice makes perfect when it comes to playing pontoon online casino caesar slots games The more you play, the better you’ll become at making smart decisions and winning more often. So hop in a seat at an online casino today and start honing your skills!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use hot &amp; cold tables to your advantage If you notice that one table is consistently paying out more than others, stick around and ride the wave! Conversely, if you see that a particular table is losing money for everyone, move on before you lose too much cash.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7 Don’t be afraid to split pairs When you have two equal cards (eights, nines, tens), splitting them into two separate hands gives you twice the chance of winning – so don’t shy away from doing this if the opportunity arises! Just be sure to play each hand cautiously and only bet what you can afford to lose if both hands end up busting .</p>
<p>8 Double down on 11 If you’re feeling lucky, doubling down on an 11 can be a great way to increase your chances of winning big bucks at pontoon . Just make sure that the dealer doesn’t have an ace up his sleeve – because if he does, things could go downhill quickly!</p>
<p>9 Remember Insurance When the dealer has an ace showing , be sure to take out insurance – even if it means putting less money back into the pot . Doing this gives you some protection against going bust , which can be crucial during high-stakes games .</p>
<p>10 Stick with reputable casinos It’s always important to stick with reputable casinos when playing online pontoon . Not only does this ensure fair gameplay , but it also guarantees that you’ll receive timely payouts when cashing in your winnings .</p>

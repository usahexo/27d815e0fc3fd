<h1 id="Assembly-Passes-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-New-York"><a href="#Assembly-Passes-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Assembly Passes Bill to Legalize Sports Betting in New York"></a>Assembly Passes Bill to Legalize Sports Betting in New York</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on Monday, the New York State Assembly approved a bill to legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, which now heads to the Senate for consideration, would authorize casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The bill would also allow mobile betting and betting on college games.</p>
<p>“This is something that we’ve been working on for quite some time and we’re very happy that it was able to move forward today with a unanimous vote,” said Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s Racing and Wagering Committee.</p>
<p>Pretlow said there was no reason for the state not to legalize sports betting, given that it is already happening illegally.</p>
<p>“It’s here. It’s been going on, so why not regulate it and make sure the people who are doing it are doing it in a legal way?” he said.</p>
<p>Proponents of the bill argue that it could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state government, as well as create jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>But critics contend that legalizing sports betting could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it would be unfair to exclude New Yorkers who don’t live near a casino or racetrack from being able to place bets.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Assembly-Votes-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#New-York-Assembly-Votes-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="New York Assembly Votes to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>New York Assembly Votes to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>In a major victory for the gambling industry, the New York Assembly voted on Tuesday to legalize sports betting in the state. The bill, which was sponsored by Democrat Deputy Leader Gary Pretlow, passed by a vote of 77-22.</p>
<p>The passage of the bill is seen as a major win for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for legalization of sports betting for years. The move is also seen as a major blow to New Jersey, which has been attempting to legalize sports betting since 2012.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, sports betting would be regulated by the New York State Gaming Commission. The bill allows for wagering on professional and amateur sports, including baseball, basketball, football, soccer and hockey. It also allows for wagers on collegiate events taking place in New York and other states.</p>
<p>The proposed bill imposes a 10 percent tax on gaming revenue generated by sports betting operations. That money would go towards funding education programs in the state.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law. However, Pretlow believes that Cuomo will support the measure. “I’ve spoken to the governor about it; he’s in favor of it,” Pretlow said.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems in the state. However, Pretlow dismisses those concerns, noting that there are already many forms of legalized gambling available in New York. “There’s horse racing, casino gaming, video lottery terminals – this is just another form of gaming that people can participate in if they want to bet on sports,” Pretlow said.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-Sports-Betting-Headed-to-New-York-After-State-Assembly-Vote"><a href="#Legal-Sports-Betting-Headed-to-New-York-After-State-Assembly-Vote" class="headerlink" title="Legal Sports Betting Headed to New York After State Assembly Vote"></a>Legal Sports Betting Headed to New York After State Assembly Vote</h1><p>A bill legalizing sports betting in New York has passed the state Assembly and is now on its way to the Senate.</p>
<p>The Assembly voted 89-40 in favor of the legislation, which would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting. The bill would also allow mobile sports betting.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, the bill had strong support from Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has said that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $300 million in annual revenue for the state.</p>
<p>“It is an important day in the ongoing effort to recapture New York state tax dollars that have gone to other states, and to create jobs,” Cuomo said in a statement after the vote.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill worry that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates, but Pretlow says that regulated sports betting will be more responsible than illegal offshore bookmakers.</p>
<p>“This is not going to steer people into committing suicide or ruin their lives,” he said. “If it does, then we have a bigger problem in this country.”</p>
<p>If the Senate approves the bill, New York would join six other states – Delaware, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington – that have already legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Now-Legal-in-New-York"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Now-Legal-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Now Legal in New York"></a>Sports Betting Now Legal in New York</h1><p>After a long wait, sports betting is now legal in the state of New York. The New York Gaming Commission has announced that starting today, people can legally bet on games at the state’s four upstate casinos.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for the people of New York,” said commission chairman Kevin Quinn. “We’re excited to finally offer this popular form of entertainment to our residents.”</p>
<p>Casino officials are also eager to get started. “Sports betting is a big part of the gaming industry nationwide, and we’re looking forward to offering it here in New York,” said Brian Sampson, executive director of the Seneca Gaming Corporation.</p>
<p>So far, there is no word on when online sports betting will be available in New York. In other states where it is legal, such as Nevada and Delaware, people can place bets through their smartphones or computers.</p>
<p>How Does Sports Betting Work?</p>
<p>If you’re new to sports betting, here’s a quick overview of how it works. Basically, you make a bet on which team will win or lose a game. The odds are usually expressed in terms of how much you’ll win if you bet $100. So, for example, if the odds are +250 on a team, that means you’ll win $250 if you bet $100 on that team winning.</p>
<p>You can also bet on how many points will be scored in a game, who will score first, and lots of other things. There are even props (short for propositions) bets available on things like whether or not a player will score 3 points in a game or whether there will be a safety.</p>
<p>What Types of Bets Are Available?</p>
<p>There are three basic types of bets: moneyline bets, point spread bets, and totals (or OVER&#x2F;UNDER) bets. Let’s take a look at each one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moneyline Bets - With moneyline bets, you simply pick which team will win the game outright. The odds vary depending on which team is favored and which team is underdog. For example, the odds might be -200 for Team A and +150 for Team B. This means that if you bet $200 on Team A winning, you would only win $100 back (plus your original $200). On the other hand, if you bet $100 on Team B winning, you would win $150 back (plus your original $100). SoTeam A would need to win by more than 2 points to cover the spread in this example.</li>
<li>Point Spread Bets - With point spread bets, you are betting that one team will beat the other by more than the point differential shown in the line. For example, in our earlier example with Team A -200 and Team B +150 underdogs respectively; If somebody were to wager say 100$ dollars on Team A they’d lay -2000 total in order to attempt to receive 100$ plus their risked 100$ (+&#x2F;- any payouts given) from said victory should it occur . Conversely ,if somebody wagered 100$ dollars on Team B they’d receive 2000 total risked if said team pulled off an upset victory against Team A . So again using 200 as an example ,the person most likely needs 201+ points scored between both teams instead of just 2 points difference as found with moneylines …this would cover their losses (-200 risked) whilst netting them an extra 1000$ should they have chosen correctly .  Points spreads generally give one side around -110 odds whilst the other side receives around EVEN money so there’s no real favourite per se .  3) Totals (OVER&#x2F;UNDER) Bets - Totals (OVER&#x2F;UNDER) bets are just what they sound like - you’re betting on whether or not the total number of points scored in a game will be over or under the set number (usually 57). So for example, let’s say that the set number for an upcoming game is 57 points and you think that both teams will score more than that amount combined. You would then place an OVER bet on that game. If however you think that neither team will score more than 57 points combined, you would place an UNDER bet.</li>
</ol>

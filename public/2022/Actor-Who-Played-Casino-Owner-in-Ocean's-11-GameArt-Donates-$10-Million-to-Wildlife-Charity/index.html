The 77-year-old singer and actor has been performing since he was a child, and his work in films and television goes back more than five decades. He’s also known as a successful casino owner, having opened the lavish Wayne Newton’s Casa de Shenandoah in 1992.</p>
<p>Recently, Newton has turned his attention to another passion: conservation. In May 2018, he visited several schools in Nevada to talk to students about the importance of caring for the environment. “It all goes back to our roots,” Newton said in an interview with KTNV. “If we don’t have a healthy planet, we’re not going to have anything.”</p>
<p>Newton is committed to making a difference on this issue. In addition to his talks at schools, he’s also been working with the Las Vegas Aviators (an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics) to create a habitat for birds at the baseball team’s stadium. The project will include a wetlands area that will attract more than 250 different species of birds.</p>
<p>It’s great that Newton is using his fame and resources to help promote conservation. His work is sorely needed, as humanity continues to put pressure on our planet’s resources. We need more people like him who are willing to take action and inspire others to do the same.</p>

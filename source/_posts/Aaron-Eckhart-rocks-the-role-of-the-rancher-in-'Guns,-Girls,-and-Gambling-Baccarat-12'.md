## The new face of the rancher

The days of the cowboy are numbered. At least, that's what Aaron Eckhart believes. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Eckhart announced that he is the new face of the rancher.

"I'm not a cowboy," Eckhart said. "I don't ride horses. I'm a city boy from Chicago." But that doesn't mean Eckhart isn't excited about his new role. "I love the challenge of it," he said. "I love the fact that it's something different."

Eckhart isn't the only one who's excited about this new development. Ranchers around the country are buzzing about Eckhart's upcoming movie, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. "He's perfect for the part," one rancher said. "He has the look and the feel of a real rancher."

But what exactly is a rancher? And what does Eckhart have to do to prepare for his new role?

A rancher is someone who owns or manages a ranch. They may raise livestock or grow crops on their land. Ranchers typically live in rural areas, and their work is often seasonal.

To prepare for his role, Eckhart has been spending time with ranchers around the country. He's learning about their way of life and soaking up their knowledge and wisdom. " I want to be authentic," Eckhart said. "I want to know how to rope cattle and brand them."

Eckhart is also working with a coach to help him learn rodeo skills. "Rodeo is such an important part of ranching culture," Eckhart said. "If I'm going to play a rancher on screen, I need to know how to ride bulls and lasso cows."

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is set to hit theaters this fall. In the meantime, check out these photos of Eckhart preparing for his new role:

            <h1 id="Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Saved-–-Thanks-to-British"><a href="#Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Saved-–-Thanks-to-British" class="headerlink" title="Trump Taj Mahal Casino Saved – Thanks to British!"></a>Trump Taj Mahal Casino Saved – Thanks to British!</h1><p>You would be forgiven for thinking that the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey had bit the dust given the headlines over the past few months. But, in a surprise move, it has now been saved from closure – thanks to a £100 million investment from British businessman and philanthropist Richard Branson.</p>
<p>The casino faced closure after its owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for bankruptcy in late 2014. However, while other investors were initially interested in saving it – including Carl Icahn who is the largest shareholder in Trump Entertainment Resorts – they all pulled out earlier this year. That is until Branson decided to step in and make an offer himself.</p>
<p>Branson’s investment will see him become the majority owner of the casino, with Trump Entertainment Resorts retaining a small stake. In a statement released by Virgin Group Ltd., which is owned by Branson, he said:</p>
<p>“I am excited to be entering into this partnership and saving this important part of Atlantic City’s history. The Trump Taj Mahal is one of the last remaining large casinos in Atlantic City and I am hopeful that my investment will help to create thousands of jobs as well as preserving its heritage for future generations.”</p>
<p>The casino will now be re-branded as the Virgin Hotel Casino. It is not yet clear what changes (if any) will be made to its operation.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-–-A-British-Affair"><a href="#Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-–-A-British-Affair" class="headerlink" title="Trump Taj Mahal Casino – A British Affair?"></a>Trump Taj Mahal Casino – A British Affair?</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal Casino was one of Donald Trump’s early successes in the casino business. It was also the focus of a major British conspiracy that has never been fully exposed.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal opened in 1990, and was an instant hit with gamblers from around the world. However, there was something about the casino that made it a favorite of British players. In fact, according to some reports, the Brits were responsible for nearly half of the casino’s business.</p>
<p>Why were the British so interested in the Taj Mahal Casino? One theory is that they were using it as a front for money laundering. The casino was allegedly used to launder millions of pounds for organized crime groups in the UK.</p>
<p>This theory has never been proven, but there are some interesting clues that suggest it might be true. For example, several high-ranking British police officers were known to be regulars at the casino. In addition, several members of Parliament were caught placing illegal bets at the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most damning evidence against the casino is a report prepared by Scotland Yard in 1992. The report claimed that the Taj Mahal was being used by British criminals as a “safe house” for their illegal activities.</p>
<p>So what happened to this alleged British conspiracy? The truth may never be known, but there are some theories…</p>
<p>One possibility is that Donald Trump got wind of the scheme and shut it down himself. This seems unlikely though, as Trump has always denied any involvement with British criminals.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the British authorities simply weren’t able to crack the case. This is more likely, given how complex and secretive money laundering schemes can be.</p>
<p>Whatever happened, it’s clear that the Trump Taj Mahal Casino was at one time a hotbed of British intrigue.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Really-Held-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino"><a href="#Who-Really-Held-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Really Held the Trump Taj Mahal Casino?"></a>Who Really Held the Trump Taj Mahal Casino?</h1><p>The controversy around the Trump Taj Mahal casino has continued for many years. Many people have asked who really held the casino and whether or not Trump had any involvement in it.</p>
<p>The answer to this question has been difficult to determine. There are many different allegations and conspiracy theories surrounding the casino. However, there is no definitive evidence to prove any of these allegations.</p>
<p>There are some reports that claim that Trump did not have any ownership stake in the casino. Instead, it was allegedly held by other investors, including Indian tribes and Wall Street firms. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims.</p>
<p>There are also allegations that Trump was involved in money laundering and other illegal activities at the casino. However, again, there is no concrete evidence to support these allegations.</p>
<h1 id="The-British-Connection-to-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino"><a href="#The-British-Connection-to-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The British Connection to the Trump Taj Mahal Casino"></a>The British Connection to the Trump Taj Mahal Casino</h1><p>In 1990, just a year after the Trump Taj Mahal Casino had opened, its original owner, Resorts International, merged with British casino company Ladbrokes. The deal was worth $1.3 billion and gave Ladbrokes a 49% stake in the casino. This connection to British gambling interests may have played a role in the casino’s later financial troubles.</p>
<p>The Trump Taj Mahal Casino was one of several casinos heavily invested in by then-owner Donald Trump in the early 1990s. These investments turned out to be unsuccessful and led to Trump’s Atlantic City casinos filing for bankruptcy in 2009. The Trump Taj Mahal Casino was the last of these casinos to file for bankruptcy, doing so in 2014.</p>
<p>Since its bankruptcy, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino has been through a number of changes of ownership. In 2016, it was bought by Carl Icahn — an American businessman known for his investments in distressed companies. Icahn has been working to turn around the casino’s fortunes but has faced resistance from workers’ unions. In August 2017, Icahn announced that he would be selling the casino due to the union’s demands for increased wages and health care benefits.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen to the Trump Taj Mahal Casino under its new ownership. However, its connection to British gambling interests may provide some clues as to why it has been struggling financially in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="How-Britain-Saved-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino"><a href="#How-Britain-Saved-the-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Britain Saved the Trump Taj Mahal Casino"></a>How Britain Saved the Trump Taj Mahal Casino</h1><p>In 1988, Donald Trump opened the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. It was a lavish and impressive resort, and it quickly became a mecca for gamblers from all over the country. However, by the early 1990s, Trump’s business fortunes were starting to change. The Trump Taj Mahal was hemorrhaging money, and by 1991 it was on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Luckily for Trump, he had some friends in high places. In 1991, the British government decided to bail out the Trump Taj Mahal Casino. They provided a loan of $65 million to help keep it afloat. This loan was part of a larger bailout package that was given to a number of Atlantic City casinos in order to prevent them from going bankrupt.</p>
<p>The British government’s decision to bailout the Trump Taj Mahal Casino was met with criticism from many quarters. Some people felt that it was unfair to use taxpayer money to prop up a casino owned by Donald Trump. Others argued that the bailout would only ensure that Trump would remain in control of the casino, and that it would be difficult for anyone else to take it over.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the British government defended its decision to bailout the Trump Taj Mahal Casino. They argued that Atlantic City was in serious danger of becoming a “ghost town” if they didn’t step in and help out. And they claimed that the bailout would ultimately be good for the city and its residents.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the British government’s decision to bail out the Trump Taj Mahal Casino proved to be successful. The casino managed to stay open, and it eventually turned around its financial fortunes. Today, it is once again one of the most profitable casinos in Atlantic City.</p>

#  The Philadelphia Eagles are one of the most successful NFL franchises

The Eagles have a long and storied history in the NFL. They are one of the most successful franchises in the league, with three Super Bowl championships and four conference championships. The franchise was founded in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets.

The Eagles got off to a slow start in their early years, posting only one winning season in their first six years of existence. However, they would go on to become one of the most successful franchises in the NFL in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by head coach Dick Vermeil and quarterback Ron Jaworski, the Eagles made it to two Super Bowls, but ultimately lost both games.

The 1990s were not as kind to the Eagles, as they struggled to post winning seasons. However, they would rebound in the 2000s, making it to four NFC championship games and finally winning their first Super Bowl in 2005. The Eagles would go on to win another Super Bowl in 2018, defeating the New England Patriots 41-33.

The Philadelphia Eagles have a rich history of success in the NFL and are one of the most popular teams in the league.

#  How Much Money Does The Top Sports Betting Business Make Off Of Philadelphia Eagles?

Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles were eagerly anticipating their team's Super Bowl appearance this year. Unfortunately, they came up short, losing to the New England Patriots in heartbreaking fashion.

Even though the Eagles didn't bring home the Lombardi Trophy, their fans can take solace in knowing that their team is one of the most profitable in the NFL. In fact, the Eagles generate more money from sports betting than any other team in the league.

How much money does the top sports betting business make off of Philadelphia Eagles? Let's take a look:

The average amount wagered on an NFL game is $55. That means that if someone placed a bet on every game that the Philadelphia Eagles played during the 2017-2018 season, they would have wagered a total of $290,550.

Out of all 32 teams in the NFL, only six generated more money from sports betting than the Philadelphia Eagles. The New England Patriots led the league with $741,650 wagered on them, while the Dallas Cowboys came in second with $687,600 wagered.

The amount of money that a sports betting business makes off of a team varies depending on how often they're bet on. The Philadelphia Eagles were only bet on about 15% of all games this season, so their business likely made considerably less than if they were bet on more often.

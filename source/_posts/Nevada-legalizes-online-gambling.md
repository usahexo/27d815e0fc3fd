#  Nevada legalizes online gambling

Nevada became the first US state to legalize online gambling on Tuesday, following the passage of a bill by the Nevada state legislature. The new law allows casinos in Nevada to offer online poker and other casino games to people inside the state.

Officials say that the new law will help to boost tourism in Nevada, as people will now be able to gamble online from anywhere in the state. Nevada's casinos are already some of the most popular in the world, and the online gambling industry is expected to be worth billions of dollars annually.

The new law is also expected to create jobs in Nevada, as casinos will need to hire staff to manage their online operations. Some experts believe that the law could also lead to an increase in crime, as people may be more likely to gamble if they can do so from the comfort of their own home.

Despite these concerns, most observers believe that the benefits of legalized online gambling outweigh the risks. As more and more states legalize online gambling, it is likely that this industry will continue to grow at a rapid pace.

#  Delaware expands online gambling

Delaware has been on the forefront of online gambling legalization and this week they have announced that they are expanding their online gambling offerings. The first state to legalize online gambling, Delaware has been in a leadership position for the past few years when it comes to internet wagering.

The new expansion will include Table Games, Video Poker, and Slots. Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway, and Dover Downs will all offer the new games starting on September 1st. This follows on the heels of a recent agreement between the three racinos to share player pools. This should result in increased traffic at all three locations.

Online poker is currently available in Delaware through three licensed operators; DNTCasino, PokerStarsNJ, and 888Poker. With the addition of table games and slots, there are now over 600 casino games available to Delaware residents online.

While other states have legalized online gambling since Delaware first did so in 2013, none have matched their comprehensive offering. In states like New Jersey and Nevada, online gambling is limited to just poker and casino games. In Pennsylvania, which legalized online gambling in 2017, only casino games are available.

One potential challenge for Delaware is the low population density of the state. With less than a million residents, there are not enough players to support a robust online gambling market. This has resulted in a situation where each of the three licensed operators are required to offer their services statewide.

This is in contrast to states like Nevada and New Jersey where licenses are awarded to specific casinos or racinos with larger player pools. It will be interesting to see if Delawareâ€™s approach can be successful in light of these challenges.

#  New Jersey wins Supreme Court case to allow legalized online gambling

The state of New Jersey won a landmark case in the Supreme Court on Monday that paves the way for legalized online gambling. The court ruled 6-3 in favor of New Jersey, overturning a federal law that had banned online gambling.

Governor Chris Christie hailed the ruling as a victory for the people of New Jersey. "I'm proud that our state led the charge in taking on this unconstitutional federal overreach," said Christie. "This decision will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for our state, and create thousands of new jobs."

Online gambling is already legal in Nevada, Delaware, and New York, but the industry is expected to grow rapidly now that it is legal nationwide. Analysts estimate that the U.S. online gambling market will be worth $10 billion by 2020.

The court's ruling is a major defeat for Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who has fought hard to keep online gambling illegal. Adelson has spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to ban online gambling, arguing that it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for many Americans.

Adelson was not present at the Supreme Court hearing on Monday, but he issued a statement vowing to continue his fight against online gambling. "I am disappointed but not surprised by today's decision," said Adelson. "I will continue to fight against this harmful activity and protect American adults from its devastating effects."

#  Michigan considers legalizing online gambling

Michigan lawmakers are considering legalizing online gambling in the state. Proponents of the measure argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents contend that it could lead to greater addiction problems.

Michigan is one of several states that has been debating the issue of online gambling in recent months. In December, New Jersey became the third state in the nation to legalize online casino gambling, following Delaware and Nevada.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a convenient way for people to gamble and that it could generate significant revenue for the state. Opponents, however, contend that it could lead to greater addiction problems and social ills.

The Michigan House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure this week.

#  California considering legalizing online poker

The state of California is considering legalizing online poker, as reported by the <a href= " http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-california-online-poker-20160915-snapstory.html " >Los Angeles Times</a>. The proposal, which was presented to the state legislature by Assemblyman Adam Gray on Wednesday, would allow licensed businesses in California to offer online poker games to residents of the state.

Gray's proposal has the support of a number of powerful groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce and the Poker Players Alliance. If approved, the measure would generate an estimated $380 million in annual tax revenue for the state.

Online poker is currently illegal in California, as it is in most other states. However, due to the way that online poker is regulated, it is relatively easy for Californians to play on offshore websites that are not subject to US law. Gray's proposal would legalize and regulate the industry, giving players assurance that the games they are playing are fair and that their money is safe.

The proposed bill comes at a time when other states are also reconsidering their stance on online poker. In August, New Jersey became the third state in the US to legalize online poker after Nevada and Delaware. Other states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, are also considering legalizing the game.

Proponents of online poker argue that it is a skill game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and incomes. They argue that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states, as well as a way to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators.

Opponents of online poker argue that it is addictive and can lead to gambling addiction. They also argue that it can be used by criminal organizations to launder money.

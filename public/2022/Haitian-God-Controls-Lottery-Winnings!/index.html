            <h1 id="Haitian-God-Controls-Lottery-Winnings"><a href="#Haitian-God-Controls-Lottery-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Haitian God Controls Lottery Winnings!"></a>Haitian God Controls Lottery Winnings!</h1><p>A Haitian lottery player is convinced that the god Ogoun controls which numbers come up in the lottery, and he credits Ogoun with helping him win big twice.</p>
<p>Haitian lottery players often pray to various gods in the hope of winning the jackpot, and some believe that certain gods are more likely to help them win than others. Ogoun is one of the most popular gods invoked by lottery players, and many Haitians believe that he can help them win the big prize.</p>
<p>One lottery player from Port-au-Prince is convinced that Ogoun has helped him win the jackpot twice. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he has always been a faithful follower of Ogoun and that he believes the god has given him lucky numbers. He credits Ogoun with helping him win a total of $60,000 in two separate lotteries.</p>
<p>“I have never stopped believing in Ogoun, and I know that he has given me these numbers,” said the man. “He is my lucky charm and I will always follow him.”</p>
<p>Other Haitians who have won big in the lottery also say that they owe their good fortune to one of the gods. Marie Carmelle Jean Baptiste, who won over $1 million in a lottery draw last year, says she prayed to lwa Erzulie for luck and believes she was blessed with good numbers.</p>
<p>While some people may be skeptical about attributing luck to divine intervention, there is no doubt that some Haitian lottery winners believe passionately in the power of their gods. And as long as there are believers, there will continue to be those who turn to divinity in hopes of winning big in the lottery.</p>
<h1 id="Haitian-God-Shows-Favoritism-In-Gambling-Games"><a href="#Haitian-God-Shows-Favoritism-In-Gambling-Games" class="headerlink" title="Haitian God Shows Favoritism In Gambling Games"></a>Haitian God Shows Favoritism In Gambling Games</h1><p>There is a God in Haiti that many people believe in and he is known as the god of gambling games. This deity is often called on by gamblers to help them win money, and some people even believe that he will help them get out of debt. But recently, there have been complaints that this god is only helping certain people win money, and he is not playing fair.</p>
<p>One man who goes by the name of Richard said that he has lost a lot of money in recent gambling games because the god keeps favoring other players. He even claims that the deity was responsible for him losing a large sum of money in a game of bingo. “I was really upset when I lost that money,” said Richard. “I had been saving up for months to buy a new car, but now I might have to wait longer because of this god.”</p>
<p>Others have also complained about the Haitian gambling god’s apparent bias. One woman named Marie said that she had been winning games regularly until recently, when she started losing consistently. “It’s really unfair,” said Marie. “I think this god is only helping those who give him offerings, and I don’t have enough money to bribe him.”</p>
<p>Despite the complaints, many people in Haiti still believe in the gambling god and continue to call on him for help. Some say that he has helped them win large sums of money in the past, and they are confident that he will do so again in the future. Whether or not this deity actually favors some players over others is up for debate, but one thing is for sure: he definitely has a big impact on gambling games in Haiti.</p>
<h1 id="Haitian-God-Steals-Winnings-In-Gambling-Game"><a href="#Haitian-God-Steals-Winnings-In-Gambling-Game" class="headerlink" title="Haitian God Steals Winnings In Gambling Game"></a>Haitian God Steals Winnings In Gambling Game</h1><p>Last week, in a small town located in the southern part of Haiti, God allegedly decided to intervene in a gambling game and help Himself to some of the winnings. The story has made headlines throughout the country, with many people expressing their disbelief that God would resort to such measures.</p>
<p>According to witnesses, the game was taking place at a small casino in the town square when God suddenly appeared and demanded His share of the winnings. The players were said to be very startled by this turn of events and did not know what to do. One of them eventually handed over a bag containing $2000 in cash, which God took without saying a word.</p>
<p>This incident has caused a lot of controversy in Haiti, with some people arguing that it is a sign that God is angry with them and others saying that it is a sign of His protection. Some religious leaders are even claiming that this is a sign that Haiti will soon be blessed with great wealth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you believe about this incident, it is hard to deny that it has generated a lot of buzz in Haiti. Gambling is frowned upon by many in Haiti, but this story has given it new life and has people talking about it all over the country.</p>
<h1 id="Haitian-God-Causes-Loser-To-Win-In-Gambling-Game"><a href="#Haitian-God-Causes-Loser-To-Win-In-Gambling-Game" class="headerlink" title="Haitian God Causes Loser To Win In Gambling Game"></a>Haitian God Causes Loser To Win In Gambling Game</h1><p>Some people believe that there is a Haitian god who causes people to win in gambling games. There have been stories of people who have gone to Haiti to gamble, and they have won big. Some people believe that the god is actually a goddess, known as Erzulie.</p>
<p>There are many stories about this Haitian goddess and her ability to help people win in gambling games. One story tells the tale of a man who went to a casino in Haiti and lost all of his money. He was about to leave when he saw the goddess Erzulie sitting at a blackjack table. He asked her for help, and she gave him the winning hand. He ended up winning $10,000.</p>
<p>There are other stories about this Haitian goddess and her ability to help people win in gambling games. One story tells the tale of a woman who went to Haiti to gamble, and she lost all of her money. She was about to leave when she saw the goddess Erzulie sitting at a blackjack table. She asked her for help, and she gave her the winning hand. The woman ended up winning $5,000.</p>

<h1 id="Why-Does-Haitian-God-Control-Who-Wins-Or-Loses-In-Gambling"><a href="#Why-Does-Haitian-God-Control-Who-Wins-Or-Loses-In-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Haitian God Control Who Wins Or Loses In Gambling?"></a>Why Does Haitian God Control Who Wins Or Loses In Gambling?</h1><p>The Haitian god Damballah is often called upon to help gamblers win, and some people believe that he actually decides who wins and loses. But why does this god have such power over gambling?</p>
<p>One explanation is that Damballah is the god of luck, and believers think that he can help them win by increasing their good fortune. Another explanation is that Haitians believe that Damballah can control fate, and they think that if they pray to him for help they will be more likely to win.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that Damballah has a powerful influence over gambling in Haiti. Many people believe that if they pray to him they will be more likely to win, and many go to great lengths to try and please him. For example, some people make offerings of money or food to him, or they perform special ceremonies before starting a gambling session.</p>
<p>There is even a special dance called the danse Damballah that is performed in his honor. This dance is said to bring good luck to the dancers, and it is often performed by people who are about to gamble.</p>
<p>So why does Haitian god Damballah control who wins or loses in gambling? There are several possible explanations, but nobody knows for sure what makes this god so powerful when it comes to gambling. However, there is no doubt that many Haitians believe in his power, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to receive his blessing.</p>
